MASTER 0.30

MASTER is part of the Serial Device Simulator project.

MASTER is a simple program to test your serial device.

MASTER is easy to use. You may

1: enter some test command
2: press ENTER to send it over the serial port
3: wait to read the response

If you need to read more from the serial port just press ENTER.

If you want to stop the program give the 'end' command; e.g. type in end and press ENTER.


You may configure MASTER by adapting the MASTER.INI file. By default
this file is as follows:

comport:1
baudrate:9600
databits:8
stopbits:1
parity:none
responses:2

Most lines speak for themselves. The last line is a bit odd. The 'responses' value
is the number of times MASTER will read a line from the device. In many cases the
number of response lines is just 1, but in some cases in might be 2 (or more).
